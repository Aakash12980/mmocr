## Introduction

MMOCR is an open-source toolbox based on PyTorch and mmdetection for text detection, text recognition, and the corresponding downstream tasks including key information extraction. It is part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The main branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+**.

### Major Features

- **Comprehensive Pipeline**

  The toolbox supports not only text detection and text recognition, but also their downstream tasks such as key information extraction.

- **Multiple Models**

  The toolbox supports a wide variety of state-of-the-art models for text detection, text recognition and key information extraction.

- **Modular Design**

  The modular design of MMOCR enables users to define their own optimizers, data preprocessors, and model components such as backbones, necks and heads as well as losses. Please refer to [Getting Started](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for how to construct a customized model.

- **Numerous Utilities**

  The toolbox provides a comprehensive set of utilities which can help users assess the performance of models. It includes visualizers which allow visualization of images, ground truths as well as predicted bounding boxes, and a validation tool for evaluating checkpoints during training.  It also includes data converters to demonstrate how to convert your own data to the annotation files which the toolbox supports.

## What's New

v0.6.0 was released in 2022-05-05.

1. We support [MASTER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02562) and [DBNet++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10304) now!
2. Three dataset converters are added: LSVT, RCTW, and HierText.
3. MMOCR now can load data from LMDB dataset. [Doc](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html#convert-text-recognition-dataset-to-lmdb-format)
4. We provide a script to convert .json labels obtained by **Labelme** into MMOCR-supported data format.
